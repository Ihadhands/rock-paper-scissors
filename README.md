# rock-paper-scissors

For this project I have created a rock paper scissors game<br>
using javaScript. This was done with the use of functions <br>
for gathering both user input and computer input. running <br>
if and else statements and while statements to check conditions <br>
have been met to proceed. the score was kept track with Increments <br>
and console.logs. to play this game when first loading the page <br>
open the console in dev tools. <br>
This was done for the odin project.
