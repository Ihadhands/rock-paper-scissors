# rock-paper-scissors


For this project the task was to create a functional <br>
rock, paper, scissors game. The initial project <br>
required writing javaScript functions to make the <br>
game playable within dev tools console. The project <br>
also needed to compare the results in a 5 round game <br>
and print out the winner. <br>

The second part of the assignment was to create a UI <br>
to show the use of DOM manipulators and events. <br>
The game does function well but will need a re-edit <br>
in the future to implement a try again button, instead <br>
of just needing to press the RPS buttons until the end <br>
condition is met. <br>
